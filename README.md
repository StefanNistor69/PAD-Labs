# Beats Marketplace Microservices Application

## Application Suitability

1. **Why is this application relevant?**
   - The music industry is increasingly shifting to digital platforms for purchasing, sharing, and promoting beats. Beat marketplaces like BeatStars are at the forefront of this movement, enabling creators to sell and musicians to buy high-quality beats.
   - A decentralized and modular platform like this is ideal for independent musicians who want to access beats globally and efficiently. Having services like chat, purchasing, and music streaming handled independently improves reliability and scalability.

2. **Why does this application require a microservice architecture?**
   - A Beats Marketplace requires several distinct components, such as beat upload management, user authentication, purchasing, and chat functionalities. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
   - If one service fails (e.g., chat service), the other services (e.g., music player, purchasing) can continue operating, increasing reliability. This architecture also allows different teams to work on separate services without interfering with each other’s work.

## Service Boundaries

- **User Management Service**: Handles user authentication, registration, profile management, and account settings.
- **File Management Service**: Manages file uploads, storage, and streaming of music beats. Includes beat metadata and file conversions.
- **Purchasing Service**: Manages purchases, payment processing, and transaction records.
- **Chat Service**:  Provides real-time messaging between users (e.g., for negotiating purchases or collaborations).
- **Notification Service**: Manages real-time notifications for users, such as purchase confirmations, beat uploads, or messages from other users.

## Technology Stack and Communication Patterns

- **User Management Service**
  Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)
  Database: MongoDB (for storing user profiles)
  -ession Management: Redis

- **File Management Service**
  Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)
  Storage: AWS S3 (for storing audio files)
  Database: MongoDB (for storing file metadata)
  Audio Processing: FFMPEG (for file conversions and streaming)

- **Purchasing Service**
  Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)
  Payment Integration: Stripe API (for payment handling)
  Database: MongoDB (for storing purchase history)
 
- **Chat Service**
  Backend: JavaScript (Node.js with WebSocket)
  Cache: Redis (for storing chat states)
  Messaging: RabbitMQ (for message queues)

- **Notification Service**
  Backend: JavaScript (Node.js with WebSocket for real-time notifications)
  Cache: Redis (for storing notification states)
  Messaging: RabbitMQ (for sending notifications asynchronously)
### Communication
- **Inter-Service Communication**: REST APIs will be used for synchronous communication between the services, with RabbitMQ handling asynchronous messaging for tasks such as sending notifications or processing beat uploads.

      "purchased_beats": ["beat1", "beat2"]
    }
    
    PUT /api/users/profile/update
    {

    POST /api/users/logout
    {
      "token": "user-session-token"
    }
* **File Management Service**:
  ```json
  
   POST /api/beats/upload
    {
      "title": "Chill Vibes",
      "artist": "Producer A",
      "file_url": "s3://path_to_beat"
    }
    
    GET /api/beats/{beat_id}
    {
      "beat_id": "12345",
      "title": "Chill Vibes",
      "artist": "Producer A",
      "file_url": "s3://path_to_beat",
      "price": 50
    }
    
    GET /api/beats/stream/{beat_id}
    {
      "beat_id": "12345",
      "stream_url": "https://streaming_url_for_beat"
    }
    
    DELETE /api/beats/{beat_id}/delete
    {
      "beat_id": "12345"
    }
* **Notification Service**:
  ```json
  GET /api/notifications
    {
      "user_id": "54321",
      "notifications": [
        {
          "type": "purchase",
          "message": "Your beat has been successfully purchased",

## Deployment and Scaling

1. **Deployment:**
   Each microservice will be deployed in individual Docker containers to ensure portability and isolated environments. Docker Compose will be used to coordinate the deployment of all services together.

2. **Scaling:**
   Services will be horizontally scalable using Kubernetes for orchestration, allowing multiple instances of services like the Music Player and Beat Upload service to handle large traffic volumes efficiently.
